"So the front end instructor missed a huge part of the setup. Ngrok is a service that you need to setup yourself and your baseURL will be different from his. I googled it, set up an account, added ngrok extension to VS code and used the URL it generated instead. That was when my CORS error went away. I didn't need the @CrossOrigin notation either."

Ngrok is a software to create a tunnel from a local port to a remote server. So you have to search for a tutorial of how to do it and use the url that ngrok will give you


Edit: use it as the base url
